# ELEC0138_GrpQ_23_24
Created for documenting the codes generated while completing ELEC0138 final assignment by Group Q.
Involving with designing a security and privacy threat model (ideally regarding of a market online database), relevant attack set-ups and code implementations
and concludes by a video presentation. 
4 of us would devote about 1/2 month contributing to this.
# Coursework 1:
1. Identify assets: Identify the assets of the system, including data, applications, and 
infrastructure. 
2. Identify threats: Identify the potential security (or privacy or both)  threats to each asset, 
including internal and external threats. 
3. Assess impact: Evaluate the potential impact of each threat, including the potential 
damage to the assets and the cost of remediation. 
4. Prioritize threats: Prioritize the threats based on their impact and likelihood of occurrence 
and focus on mitigating the highest-priority threats. 
5. Design the security (or privacy or both) threats by implementing code-based attacks and 
utilizing existing tools. You will have to be as exhaustive as you can covering as many attacks 
as possible. 

# Coursework 2: Security/Privacy mitigations  
Consider the above threat model and threats, and within the context of the course: 
1. Design an app/system for security (or privacy or both) defence (including access control, 
encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention,..). 
2. Present and discuss opportunities innovation, creativity, enterprise, scalability &  
complexity analysis within your system. 
3.  Explain regulation and ethical considerations. You will have to explain how you will 
adhere to the several privacy/security regulations, GDPR in Europe and equivalent in other 
continents and explain what ethical issues may be raised by your prototype.
