Deliverables, as copied:

Coursework 1:
1. Identify assets: Identify the assets of the system, including data, applications, and 
infrastructure. 
2. Identify threats: Identify the potential security (or privacy or both)  threats to each asset, 
including internal and external threats. 
3. Assess impact: Evaluate the potential impact of each threat, including the potential 
damage to the assets and the cost of remediation. 
4. Prioritize threats: Prioritize the threats based on their impact and likelihood of occurrence 
and focus on mitigating the highest-priority threats. 
5. Design the security (or privacy or both) threats by implementing code-based attacks and 
utilizing existing tools. You will have to be as exhaustive as you can covering as many attacks 
as possible. 

Coursework 2: Security/Privacy mitigations  
Consider the above threat model and threats, and within the context of the course: 
1. Design an app/system for security (or privacy or both) defence (including access control, 
encryption, firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention,..). 
2. Present and discuss opportunities innovation, creativity, enterprise, scalability &  
complexity analysis within your system. 
3.  Explain regulation and ethical considerations. You will have to explain how you will

搭建dataset与终端terminal
实现攻击：
  内部泄露
  局域网ddos, 中间人
  弱密码，弱加密方式
  （请补充）
解决办法：
  （文档里有）
  实现federate learning（如有时间）
有可确定进度则写报告
4.16，4.17：就已有成果拍视频，剪辑等
4.18：完成报告剩余部分，如coursework 2 2.和3.，conclusion等
4.19当天： 下午4点交报告，之前最后检查＋添补
